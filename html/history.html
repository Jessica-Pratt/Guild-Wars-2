<h1> History of the Game</h1>
<p id="para1">Deveolped by ArenaNet and Published by NCSOFT, Guild Wars 2 is a set in a fantasy world called Tyria and a sequel to Guild Wars. 
The story line follows the re-emergence of Destiny's Edge, a disbanded guild dedicated to fighting the Elder Dragons, power hungry wold dominating bad guys. 
The world has little story and progresses in instanced environments that you can solo or invite friends to join you.</p>
<p id="para1">Guild Wars 2 takes place in the high fantasy world of Tyria, 250 years after the players' defeat of the great destroyer in the eye of the north expansion. 
Five so-called Elder Dragons sleeping beneath the continent have awoken in the time since Guild Wars, causing widespread destruction to Tyria and corrupting it's 
inhabitants. The once dominant humans of Tyria and in decline, supplanted from most of their land by natural disasters and war with the Charr, who have finally
reclaimed the last vestiges of their ancestral homeland of Ascalon from the humans. To the North, the Norn, a proud race of Nordic hunters, have been forced south by the rise of 
Jormag, the elder dragon of ice. In the West, the technologically advanced Asura have been forced to establish pemanent homes above ground after the minions of the 
first dragon to awaken, Primordus, took control of the depths of Tryia. Near the forests where the Ausura make their home are the Sylvari, a new race who have appeared in 
Tyria in the last 25 years, unaffected by the difficulties that plague the other races but with some as yet unexplained connection to the Elder Dragons.
To the south, the continent of Cantha has been cut off by an isolationist and xenophobic political climate, which is reinforced by Zhaitan's undead navy. The continent of Elona, 
too, has been cut off; the only hint of its continued prosperity being the ongoing battle between the lich Palawa Joko's Mordant Cresent and Kralkatorrikm the crystal 
dragon in the Crystal Desert, as well as the occassional reports from the Order of Whispers (a secretive organisation) spies. The battlle Isles have been wiped off the map entirely
 by the tidal wave caused by the re-emergance of the fallen kingdom of Orr, which came with the awakening of Zhaitan. </p>

<p id="para2">Though I have done a great many things in this game and accomplished alot of achievements, the only thing that keeps me playing this game is the WvWvW. 
World vs World is by far my favourite game style. It's open world combat on 4 massive maps, but incase that's not enough there are also objectives like towers and keeps to besiege 
and capture! Usually you play with a group of other players to defeat enemy player groups. Someone will ellect themself a leader (known as a commander) and will get an icon above their characters 
signifying to others that they are leading a group (enemies cannot see this icon). Often people will gather to this icon/commander to aid in taking obejectives and defeating enemy players for 
rewards. <br />
During the years of playing this game, I have commanded a great many times. Sometimes more successful than others, but it extremely fun and very rewarding. I have commanded on three different servers:</p>
<div id="list2"> <ol>
<li>DarkHaven</li>
<li>Gate of Madness</li>
<li>Fort Aspenwood.</li>
</ol></div>
<p id="para2">I started out on Darkhaven, and commmanded during the OCX and SEA time zone, with only a maximum of 15 players at my disposal. After two years I moved to Gate of Madness 
server and commanded there for a short time during their early NA time zone. I commanded upwards of 40 people there. But alas after a few months tragedy struck and I lost many members of my guild. 
I moved to a new server, Fort Aspenwood, to make a fresh start. I commanded only a few times when I first arrived but did not recieve the welcome I had hoped for. I stopped commanding for almost a year, 
prefering instead to follow another commander and help where I could. I often went solo, what is more commonly known as a scout or a havoc; taking possession of small points, like sentries and camps. </p>
