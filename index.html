<p id="para1">Guild Wars 2 is what is called a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG). I've been playing this game for 4 years now and so 
decided to commemorate the 4th year with a biography of my characters, in game acomplishments and my thoughts on the game so far.</p>
<p id="para1">In this game I have 40 characters to play. I play a range of characters that consist of various races, body types, proffesion and skills. 
The game offers a lot of different playstyles but my main play style is a massive scale PvP (player vs player) known to the players as WvW (world vs world vs world).
 Is this game mode three servers or alliances are pitted against each other for an entire week. Their main goal is to capture and hold objectives for as long as possible. 
 As this is the main thing I do ingame this is what I will be focused on discussing. But that doesn't mean that's all there there is to this game. I also compete in something known as SPvP (structured player vs player).
 In SPvP a group of 5 players battle another 5 players, these players can be random or a pre-formed group. The object of this game mode is to kill your enemy as many times as you can, with a side objective of 'capture the flag'.
 The third and last game mode called PvE (Player vs Environment). This game mode is something I avoid as I find it tedious and boring. 
 PvE is a game mode where players must explore the games maps/environment, help the npcs that ask your character for aid and find hidden points on the map. If you manage to complete everything on every single map in the game, 
 from quests to discovery points, you recieve items, a title, and the satisfaction of having been so OCD that you actually explored every nook and cranny the game has to offer.
